## Github pages with Jekyll to the rescue!

As of today I will use github pages with jekyll for my blog. The reason is quite simple: I love markdown.
Ever since I started my blog I always used Wordpress, but I always hated it that I had to use plugins to get what
I need (code coloring, better editor, etc.). In markdown everything I need already exists and as a side effect my posts
will get a (better?) version control too :)

**But what about the old posts on your site?**

I will port the important ones to the new system as soon as possible.

I used [jekyllbootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) to get a quick an nice blog page. If you want to do something
similar, you should check it out.
