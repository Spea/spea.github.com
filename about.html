        Hi there! My name is Martin also known as <em>Spea</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer in Berlin working for <a href="https://www.rebuy.de">rebuy reCommerce GmbH</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My focus is mostly PHP (see <a href="/projects.html">my projects</a>), but of course I also have experience in Java, C#, Typescript and
        some other languages.<br>
        In my freetime I try to contribute to some open source projects like <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a>
    </p>
